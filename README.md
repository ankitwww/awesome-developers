# awesome-developers

Inspired by [Reki Hattori's](https://github.com/rekihattori) [Awesome Programmers](https://github.com/rekihattori/awesome-programmers), here I would like to compile a shorter list of developers/programmers who had a profound impact on the industry. Reki's repo is pretty exhaustive (kudos to his hard work), I miss a few things e.g. It does not provide personal stories, work details. 

It is going to take some time to make this repo a bit valuable - Let's see how it goes. If you are reading this and have a great developer story - Send a PR 😊
